# Algebra with Python
This outline contains links and resources for the full course. Most of this course will involve videos and Google Colaboratory notebooks. Some videos will reference problems from textbooks, so here are the two textbooks we will use:<p>

1. Business Math, a Step-by-Step Handbook (2021) by Jean-Paul Oliver<br>
    [Link to the online PDF you can download](https://lyryx.com/subjects/business/business-mathematics/)<br>
2. Algebra and Trigonometry by Jay Abramson<br>

## Week 1 - Ratios and Proportions
This unit include an introduction to the course, how it will work, and how to use Google Colab. The math and code content will involve ratios, proportions, and solving for variables. As you go throught each part of this outline in sequence, watching each video and working through each Colab notebook, you will gain a full understanding of Algebra and how to write Python code to solve your Algebra problems. This will give you the foundation for deeper math, including data science.<p>
